# SPRING ANNOTATIONS OVERVIEW

## `@Component`

- Tells Spring to create and manage an object of this class automatically.
- Spring keeps track of it in the application context so it can be reused anywhere.

- You can give a component a custom name by adding a name inside the annotation, like `@Component("myBean")`.
- This name is used as the bean’s identifier in Spring’s application context.
- It helps when you want to refer to the bean by name (for example, with `@Qualifier`) or avoid name conflicts.
- If you don’t specify a name, Spring uses the default bean name (usually the class name with a lowercase first letter).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `@Autowired`

- Tells Spring to automatically connect and inject the required dependencies (objects) into this class.
- Helps avoid manual object creation and wiring.

- Can be used in three ways:
    - Field injection: Directly on a class field (not recommended for testing).
    - Constructor injection: On the constructor — preferred for immutability and easier testing.
    - Setter injection: On a setter method — useful when the dependency is optional or can be changed later.

- Constructor injection is generally recommended because it makes dependencies clear and your classes easier to test.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `@Qualifier`

- Used when there are multiple beans of the same type.
- Use `@Qualifier` to specify which Pizza bean to inject when multiple implementations exist

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `@Primary`

- Marks one bean as the default choice when there are multiple candidates.
- Spring injects this bean unless another is specifically selected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `@Bean`

#### What is it?

- `@Bean` is used in Java-based configuration to manually define and register a bean in the Spring container.
- It goes inside a class annotated with `@Configuration`.

#### Bean Naming

- By default, the name of the bean is the method name where `@Bean` is applied.
- You can customize the name using the name attribute: `@Bean(name = "myCustomBean")`

### Java-based vs Annotation-based configuration

#### Annotation-based

- You annotate classes directly with things like `@Component`, `@Service`, etc. Spring automatically detects and
  registers them via component scanning.

#### Java-based

- You use a `@Configuration` class and manually define beans with @Bean methods. This gives more control and
  customization.

### Injecting Dependencies

#### Java-based Config

- You manually pass dependencies as parameters in the method:
  ```@Bean
  public UserService userService(EmailService emailService) {
  return new UserService(emailService);
  }
  ```

#### Annotation-based Config

- You use `@Autowired` to let Spring automatically inject dependencies:
  ```@Component
  public class UserService {
  @Autowired
  private EmailService emailService;
  }
  ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stereotype Annotations - `@Controller`, `@Repository`, `@ Service`

- These annotations are all specializations of `@Component`, meaning:
    - They are all Spring-managed components, but each serves a specific purpose based on where it’s used in the
      application architecture.
    - Spring Boot uses stereotype annotations to automatically detect and register classes as beans within specific
      application layers.

| Annotation    | Layer                    | Purpose                         |
|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `@Controller` | Presentation Layer       | Handles HTTP requests/responses |
| `@Service`	   | Service (Business) Layer | Contains business logic         |
| `@Repository` | Persistence (DAO) Layer  | Manages data access logic       |

### `@Controller`

- Belongs to: Presentation Layer
- Purpose: Handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to handler methods.
- Typically used with `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

- Extra Behavior:
    - Works with Spring MVC.
    - Returns view templates (e.g., Thymeleaf) unless `@ResponseBody` or `@RestController` is used.

### `@Service`

- Belongs to: Service (Business Logic) Layer

- Purpose:
    - Contains the core logic of your application (calculations, rules, orchestration).
    - Acts as a bridge between controllers and repositories.

- Extra Behavior:
    - Can be picked up by Spring AOP for things like transactions, logging, security, etc.

### `@Repository`

- Belongs to: Persistence (DAO) Layer

- Purpose:
    - Responsible for data access (e.g., database interaction).
    - Encapsulates logic for querying, saving, updating, or deleting data.

- Extra Behavior:
    - Spring wraps method calls and translates persistence-related exceptions into Spring’s DataAccessException.

#### Layer Interaction Flow

- `@Controller` → `@Service` → `@Repository` → Database
- Each layer depends only on the one below it, promoting separation of concerns and testability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `@Lazy`

#### What is `@Lazy`?

- `@Lazy` tells Spring to delay the creation of a bean until it’s actually needed (on-demand).
- By default, Spring creates singleton beans eagerly — meaning at application startup.
- With `@Lazy`, the bean is only created when it is injected, accessed, or requested.

#### Why Use It?

- Speeds up application startup by skipping the creation of unused beans.
- Reduces memory usage if some beans are rarely used or expensive to create.
- Can help resolve circular dependencies in some cases.
- Eager initialization is generally recommended for fail-fast behavior (you find errors early).

#### Where You Can Use `@Lazy`:

| Usage Location                                  | Behavior                         |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| On a `@Component` class                         | That component is created lazily |
| On a dependency injection (`@Autowired`)        | That specific injection is lazy  |
| On a `@Bean` method in a `@Configuration` class | Only that method's bean is lazy  |
| On an entire `@Configuration` class             | All beans in that class are lazy |

#### Summary:

- Use `@Lazy` when startup performance matters, or when beans are rarely used or expensive to initialize.
- Eager (default) -> Bean is created at application startup.
- Lazy (`@Lazy`)    -> Bean is created only when it’s first accessed or injected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `@ConfigurationProperties`

#### What is `@ConfigurationProperties`?

- `@ConfigurationProperties` is used to bind external configuration (like values from application.properties or
  application.yml) to a Java object.
- It enables type-safe and structured access to configuration values, allowing developers to group related settings into
  dedicated config classes rather than scattering them throughout the code using individual @Value annotations.

#### Why Use It?

- ***Type Safety:*** Automatically converts property values to the correct Java types (e.g., `String, int, List, Map,`
  etc.).
- ***Cleaner Code:*** Encapsulates related config settings in one class instead of spreading them across multiple fields
  or components.
- ***Supports Complex Structures:*** Works well with nested objects, collections, and maps — great for real-world
  applications with layered configuration.
- ***Validation Support:*** Can be combined with @Validated to enforce constraints (e.g., not null, size limits).

#### How It Works Conceptually

- When you annotate a class with @ConfigurationProperties("prefix"), Spring will:
    - Look for configuration keys in the environment (typically application.properties or application.yml) that begin
      with the given prefix.
    - Match the remaining key paths to fields in the class, using naming conventions (e.g., kebab-case config matches
      camelCase fields).
    - Instantiate the class as a Spring-managed bean and populate its fields with the matched values.

#### Types of Properties It Supports

- ***Top-Level Properties:*** Basic key-value pairs (e.g., app.name, server.port).
- ***Nested Properties:*** Hierarchical configuration mapped to inner objects or nested field structures.
- ***Map Properties:*** Dynamically structured key-value pairs stored in a `Map<K, V>`.
- ***List/Array Properties:*** Collections of values bound to Java lists or arrays.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `@Controller` Annotation in Spring MVC

#### What is `@Controller`?

- `@Controller` is a Spring MVC annotation used to define a class as a web controller that can handle HTTP requests.
- It's part of the presentation layer of a Spring Boot application.
- Spring will detect the class during component scanning and treat it as a request handler.

#### Handler Methods

- Within a `@Controller` class, you define handler methods — these are methods that respond to specific HTTP requests.
- The most basic handler method uses `@RequestMapping`.

#### `@RequestMapping`

- `@RequestMapping` is used to map HTTP requests to specific controller methods.
- It can map based on:
    - URL path (e.g., /home)
    - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
    - Parameters, headers, and more (in advanced usage)

```@RequestMapping("/hello")
public String sayHello() {
return "Hello, world!";
}
```

#### Returning JSON — `@ResponseBody`

- By default, `@Controller` methods return view names (e.g., for rendering HTML templates).
- To return JSON or raw data, you must use the `@ResponseBody` annotation on the method:

```@RequestMapping("/hello")
@ResponseBody
public String sayHello() {
return "Hello, world!";
}
```

- `@ResponseBody` tells Spring not to resolve the return value as a view name, but instead to write it directly to the
  HTTP response body (e.g., JSON or plain text).
- Without `@ResponseBody`, the return value is treated as a view name (like home.html).

#### Summary

| Annotation        | Role                                                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Controller`     | Declares the class as a Spring MVC controller                     |
| `@RequestMapping` | Maps HTTP requests to specific methods                            |
| `@ResponseBody`   | Sends the return value directly as the HTTP response (e.g., JSON) |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `@RestController` vs `@Controller` in Spring

#### Core Concept

- Spring provides two main annotations for handling web requests:
    - `@Controller`: Used for traditional MVC web applications that return HTML views.
    - `@RestController`: Used for building RESTful APIs that return data (like JSON or XML) directly in the HTTP
      response.

#### What is `@RestController`?

- `@RestController` is a specialized version of `@Controller`.
- It combines `@Controller` & `@ResponseBody`
- This means all handler methods in a @RestController automatically return their result as the HTTP response body (not
  as a view name).
- It is designed for RESTful services rather than rendering pages.

#### Key Differences:

| Feature                | `@Controller`                           | `@RestController`                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Purpose                | MVC web app (HTML views)                | REST API (JSON/XML responses)           |
| Returns                | View names (e.g., "home")               | Data (e.g., User, List<User>)           |
| Needs `@ResponseBody`? | Yes (on each method)                    | No (it's applied automatically)         |
| Use Case               | Server-side rendered UI                 | Backend APIs or services                |
| Works with             | Thymeleaf, JSP, etc. (template engines) | API clients like Postman, frontend apps |

#### Usage Examples

- `@Controller` — Returning a View

```@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @GetMapping("/home")
    public String homePage() {
        return "home"; // Renders home.html (view)
    }
}
```

- `@RestController` — Returning JSON Data

```@RestController
public class UserApi {

    @GetMapping("/users")
    public List<String> getUsers() {
        return List.of("Alice", "Bob"); // Returned as JSON
    }
}
```

#### Summary:

- `@Controller` is used when building web applications with views.
- `@RestController` is used when building RESTful APIs that return data directly.
- Both are part of Spring Web MVC, but serve different roles:
    - `@Controller` = View-based MVC
    - `@RestController` = RESTful MVC

Use `@RestController` when the goal is to expose backend services to other applications or frontend clients.

## HTTP Request Handling Annotations (Spring MVC / REST)

___Spring provides a set of annotations to map HTTP requests to controller methods in both Spring Web MVC and Spring
REST
APIs.___

#### `@RequestMapping`

___Base annotation for mapping web requests to controller classes or methods.___

- Can be applied at both:
    - Class level: sets a base URI
    - Method level: sets specific endpoint paths or behavior

##### Features:

- Supports multiple HTTP methods (`GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,` etc.).
- Allows mapping multiple URIs to the same method.
- Optional attributes:
    - method → defines the HTTP verb
    - produces → sets response content type (e.g. application/json)
    - consumes → sets accepted request body type
- If method isn’t specified, it defaults to `GET`.

___Other mapping annotations like `@GetMapping`,` @PostMapping`, etc. are specialized shortcuts of `@RequestMapping`.___

#### `@GetMapping`

- Shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`.
- Used to fetch resources.
- Often returns data (JSON) or views (HTML), depending on `@Controller` vs `@RestController`.

#### `@PostMapping`

- Shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)`.
- Used to send data to the server, often as JSON.
- Common in REST APIs for creating new resources.
- Often paired with `@RequestBody` to map JSON input to a Java object.

#### `@RequestBody`

- Binds the incoming request body (usually JSON) to a Java object.
- Automatically handled by Spring using message converters.
- Commonly used with `@PostMapping` & `@PutMapping`.

##### Example:

```@PostMapping("/users")
public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
// user object populated from request body
}
```

#### Custom HTTP Responses

___Two main options to return HTTP status or full response structure:___

##### `@ResponseStatus`

- Sets a static HTTP status on a method or exception.
- Simple, but not flexible.

##### `ResponseEntity<T>`

- Full control of response:
    - Status code
    - Headers
    - Body
- Recommended for dynamic or more advanced responses.

##### Example:

`return new ResponseEntity<>(user, HttpStatus.CREATED);`

#### `@PutMapping`

- Shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)`.
- Used to update existing resources.
- Common usage:
    - `@PathVariable`: to bind the resource ID from the URL
    - `@RequestBody`: to bind the updated data from the request body

##### Example:

```@PutMapping("/users/{id}")
public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User updatedUser) {
// update logic
}
```

#### `@DeleteMapping`

- Shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE)`.
- Used to delete a resource by ID or other identifier.
- Often paired with `@PathVariable`.

##### Example:

`@DeleteMapping("/users/{id}")
public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
// deletion logic
}
`

##### Summary: 

|  Annotation        | Purpose                        | Common Use                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `@RequestMapping`  | Base for all mappings          | Multi-purpose, flexible     |
| `@GetMapping`      | Read/fetch data                | Retrieve resources          |
| `@PostMapping`     | Create data                    | Send JSON data to the server|
| `@PutMapping`      | Update data                    | Modify an existing resource |
| `@DeleteMapping`   | Delete data                    | Remove resource by ID       |
| `@RequestBody`     | Convert request JSON to object | Input payload (POST/PUT)    |
| `@PathVariable`    | Bind URL segment to method arg | Resource IDs                |
| `ResponseEntity`   | Custom HTTP response           | Status codes, headers, body |
